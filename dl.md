âœ… [Visualizing the Loss Landscape of Neural Nets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.09913.pdf) (Hao Li at al.)

The authors visually explain positive effect of skip-connections and wider layers 
in ResNets, as well as properly selected parameters. The is also [a repository](https://github.com/tomgoldstein/loss-landscape) 
with implementation of author's approach. (CLI tool visualizing pre-trained VGG, ResNet and DenseNet 
architectures).

> **Note:** The tool seems to be not too flexible. It is not a library or package that one could 
easily install and drop an instance of pre-trained model into visualizing method. However, it 
should possible to use models different from the models provided by authors.
